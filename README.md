# Games
This repository contains beginner level codes for games that I wrote as part of my Programming Fundamentals course.

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors
Classic game where the user plays against the computer in a match of rock, paper, and scissors.

### 2. Hangman Game
A word guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly chosen word letter by letter before running out of tries.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe
A two-player game where users take turns placing X's and O's, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
